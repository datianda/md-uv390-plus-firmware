"""Take the AT1846S retune settle apart: is the ~4.4 ms lock, filter, or neither?

Everything measured so far has treated "settle" as one number, because the probe was
always read as a single RSSI curve. It is not one thing. VK3KYY's description of the
wall is *"PLL lock time and low pass filter on the RSSI and also S/N values"* -- two
mechanisms with completely different fixes, never separated. And the trigger we pay for
(an RX off->on edge on 30H[5], costing a full receiver restart) is nowhere in the vendor
guide, whose entire frequency procedure is "write 29H and 2AH" -- so it is undocumented
behaviour rather than a datasheet requirement, and a cheaper trigger may exist.

  split      Park on fA, jump to fB with a carrier there, and report the RSSI curve and
             the noise/SNR curve SEPARATELY -- both from the same 0x1B read, so the two
             share a timestamp and need no cross-run alignment. Answers lead 1: if RSSI
             is there long before noise is, the scanner is waiting on the wrong byte.
  triggers   The same jump under every retune method, including the two controls, and a
             separation column that says which ones moved the receiver at all.
             Answers lead 2.
  regs       Snapshot every AT1846S register; diff two snapshots. Used to find which
             status bit follows the hardware squelch, by comparing carrier on vs off.
  sq         Report the squelch threshold the scanner is really using, and the live
             reading, straight from the radio (CPS 0xAC).

Needs firmware built with ENABLE_SPECTRUM. Every mode except `sq` and `regs` needs a
carrier on fB from a signal generator; NOTHING here transmits.

Examples:
  python settle.py sq
  python settle.py split    --fa 430.0 --fb 433.5 --reps 5 --csv split.csv
  python settle.py triggers --fa 430.0 --fb 433.5 --reps 3
  python settle.py regs --save carrier_on.json          # then again with TX off
  python settle.py regs --diff carrier_on.json carrier_off.json
