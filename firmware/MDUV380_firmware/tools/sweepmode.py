"""Drive the radio into VFO sweep mode, verifying each step from firmware RAM.

Injected keypresses are not reliable right after a flash -- the first one often lands
while the splash screen is still up and is swallowed. Rather than sleep-and-hope, this
reads screenOperationMode out of RAM (resolved from the flashed .elf, never hardcoded)
and retries until the radio is actually where it should be.

screenOperationMode: 0 = NORMAL, 1 = SCAN, 2 = DUAL_SCAN, 3 = SWEEP. It is VFO-only, so
it reads NORMAL in channel mode too -- the frame buffer is what distinguishes those.
